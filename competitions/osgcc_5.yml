    summary: "You are an ambitious robot that decided on a whim to major in archeology. Your
      task? To study an extinct race known as humans. Long ago, these people taunted
      the gods with nuclear force. Eventually, their civilization was wiped out by
      decades of war.

      However, it is your society that wishes to learn from these predecessors. Help
      your race by gathering the long forgotten tomes and brain matter of the former
      human species."
