    summary: "The year is 20XX. Earth has been opened to intergalactic trade, but security is
              loose and pirates are a common sight. You are a synthetic being created by a
              crime syndicate. However, you have become trapped deep inside a large space
              station while on a mission. Now you must fight your way out against the other
              robotic guards. Good luck!"
